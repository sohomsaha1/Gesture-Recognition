# Gesture-Recognition
Gesture recognizer which takes in coordinates corresponding  a persons hand written gesture, and returns the best "match" in terms of alphabetical terms.

This project uses many concepts used in our CS135 Class in uwaterloo.

There are several functions which build up to this final working code, all these functions have their own tests.

"templates.rkt" have numerous templates for different letters for my code to compare and learn from.
Using these templates we can generate a best "match" 

There are many individual tests within the code for the several functions which work together,

Math concepts learned in waterloo like softmax are also used.
