# PentoPixel
Gesture recognizer which takes in coordinates corresponding  a persons hand written gesture, and returns the best "match" in terms of alphabetical terms.

This project uses many concepts used in our CS135 Class in uwaterloo.

ML algorithms used: $family specifcally $1 and $P created by  Wobbrock, Wilson and Li of the University of Washington and Microsoft Research.

The file "templates.rkt" have several datasets of valid character and symbol data sets, recognize.rkt uses these templates 
to find the best match when given a dataset of points.


## **Recognition Statistics:** 

- Alphabetical Letters: **80.7%** (averaged, low: 71% high: 96%) Straighter letters such as i, and L have statistically better recognition rates.

- Symbols: **71.1%** (averaged, low: 55% high: 98%)

This project was enhanced from our CS 135 Assignment.
